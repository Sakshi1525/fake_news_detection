# Fake News Detection with Logistic Regression

## Overview:
  This Python project focuses on leveraging logistic regression for the accurate prediction of fake news using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the classification of news articles as either authentic or misleading, contributing to the broader efforts in combating misinformation.

## Key Components:
  ### 1. Logistic Regression Model:

   * Implemented a logistic regression model in Python to classify news articles.
   * Utilized supervised learning for training the model on labeled datasets, enabling it to distinguish between genuine and fake news.
  ### 2. Feature Engineering:

   * Employed advanced feature engineering techniques to optimize the model's predictive performance.
   * Processed and transformed input data to enhance the model's ability to identify patterns associated with fake news.
